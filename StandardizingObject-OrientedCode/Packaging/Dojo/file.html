<!-- Dojo’s package architecture is very powerful and deserves a look if you’re interested in
attempts at maintaining large code bases with JavaScript. Additionally, considering the sheer
vastness of the library, you’re bound to find some functionality that can benefit you. -->
<!-- Dojo is an incredibly popular framework that provides everything that a developer needs 
to build a full web application. This means that there are a lot of sublibraries that need to
be included and evaluated individually, otherwise the whole library would simply be too
large to handle gracefully. More information about Dojo can be found on its project site:
http://dojotoolkit.org/.
Dojo has an entire package system built around JavaScript namespacing. You can
import new packages dynamically, upon which they’re automatically executed and ready
for use. Listing 3-9 shows an example of the namespacing that is used within Dojo. -->
